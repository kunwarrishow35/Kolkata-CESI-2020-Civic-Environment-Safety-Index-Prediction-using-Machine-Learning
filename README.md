# Kolkata-CESI-2020-Civic-Environment-Safety-Index-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project presents a data-driven Civic Environment and Safety Index (CESI) model for Kolkata (2020), built using Machine Learning techniques in Python. The objective is to analyze how air quality (AQI) and crime severity levels together influence the overall livability and safety perception of a city.
